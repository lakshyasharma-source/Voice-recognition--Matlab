# Voice recognition- Matlab
 
This project was created inorder to create a software(new in itself) which could run a hardware (robot). Therefore before creating a voice recognition robot, we did R&D on how to work on the software development of a Voice Recognition tool that could train and test commands that will be coming from mike. 
And hence after this we switched to the running hardware part, which is deployed in another repository.
